This program creates a clock in basic Python that tells time only when executed and without using a while loop.
To run the program, save it with a .py extension and run it using a Python interpreter.
The program uses the datetime module to get the current time and format it using the strftime() method.
The clock displays the time in the format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM".
The clock only displays the time once when the program is executed and does not update continuously.
If you want to create a clock that updates continuously, you will need to use a while loop.
